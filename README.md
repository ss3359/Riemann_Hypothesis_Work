This is some work coding The Riemann Zeta Function and computing the zeroes of the Riemann Zeta Function on the Complex Plane. This is done entirely in C++ Code.
As a disclaimer, this is not a complete and accurate code to implement the Riemann Zeta function on the entire Complex Plane. 
There is also another version of the Riemann Hypothesis Code executed in Python. 

Hope you enjoy reading the code. Thank you!
